      <description>Abstract Data Structure interface is like a contract that specifies how we can interact with the data structure - what operations we can perform on it, what inputs it expects, and what outputs we can expect.&#xA;implementation is the code that actually makes the data structure work.&#xA;Hashing Function A hash function is a function that takes an input and deterministically converts it to an integer that is less than a fixed size set by the programmer.</description>

      <description>Ref: https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-fundamentals-of-rdma-programming&#xA;1. RDMA Bypassing OS Traditionally, most socket application uses the socket API, for example, connect, accept, send and receive. All our functions are used to pass data from one point to another.&#xA;Client connect() send() recv() Server accept() send() recv() RDMA programming is an alternative to socket programming. It gives you better latency and better utilization of your hardware if you have network interface cards that can work with it.</description>

      <title>Array and Strings</title>

      <description>Ref: https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms&#xA;1. Arrays C++ require you to specify the size and data type of the array during initialization but also have support for lists (like std::vector in C++).&#xA;2. Strings Strings are implemented differently between languages. In Python and Java, they are immutable. In C++, they are mutable.&#xA;Mutable or immutable? If you have a mutable array arr = [&amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;b&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo;] and an immutable string s = &amp;ldquo;abc&amp;rdquo;, but you want to instead represent &amp;ldquo;abd&amp;rdquo;, you can easily do arr[2] = &amp;ldquo;d&amp;rdquo;, but you cannot do s[2] = &amp;ldquo;d&amp;rdquo;.</description>
